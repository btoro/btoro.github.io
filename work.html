                <p class="">&emsp;Weak and transient interactions are principal to establish meaningful and functional biological networks. This is notably evident in RNA, where initial seeding interactions consisting of only a few base pairs determine specific structures and functions. Such transient interactions are not sufficiently stable for detection by conventional approaches. This study explored the merits of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as a possible analytical platform for the elucidation of nucleic acid binding equilibria, accentuating its strength in detecting weak and elusive interactions. First, we evaluate experimental conditions and extent of ESI-MS to study nucleic acids. We establish the practical dynamic range for analysis from 10-7 to 10-5 M. Next, we compared analysis approaches to study dimerization equilibria and elucidate dissociation constants for two binding modes: homo-dimerization and hetero-dimerization. Both single point direct determination and titration approaches yielded comparable affinities. Moreover, we explored ESI-MS unique ability to examine multiple equilibria. We devised a competition scheme that expands Kd determinations towards stronger binding, in the 10-9 M range. Furthermore, analysis of strand-exchange processes demonstrated the ability to capture low-abundance, weak complexes. The study highlighted the flexibility and robustness of this platform for the investigation of the thermodynamics of weaker nucleic acid interactions in solution.</p>

                <p class="">&emsp;Native MS constitutes an excellent approach for investigating biological processes that involve the interaction of cognate biomolecules in highly dynamic states. The formation of functional assemblies often involves conformational rearrangements that require a sequence of association, dissociation or displacement operations. This concept is illustrated by the process of genome dimerization in HIV-1 and other retroviruses, which is mediated by the dimerization initiation site (DIS) of viral RNA. This essential stem-loop domain establishes a metastable kissing complex (KC) intermediate that seeds the structural rearrangements necessary to stabilize genome dimerization. We developed a nanospray-MS approach to specifically monitor KC formation and dissociation. This approach is readily applicable to examine the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of any bimolecular interaction.</p>

                <p class="">&emsp;The dynamic nature of intra- and inter-molecular interactions enables RNA to adopt multiple metastable structures that may be kinetically trapped. Structural rearrangements are essential for RNA to enact its biological functions. Spectroscopic techniques tend to provide indirect and, therefore, limited views of these processes. Direct mass spectrometric analysis has a largely untapped potential for the investigation of structural rearrangements. We have developed an approach based on solution thermal melting and ESI-MS analysis to study the dimerization and isomerization of stemloop constructs mimicking the dimerization initiation site (DIS) of the HIV-1 genome.  The study evaluated the merits of this approach as a tool for investigating structure dynamics and for detecting the effects of small-molecule ligands in possible drug screening operations. We designed and built a heating block to regulate the temperature of our nanospray quartz emitter. The heating block allows us to set the temperature of sample solutions between 4 and 100�C with minimal fluctuations (<0.1�C at 60Hz). Direct-infusion analyses were performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific (West Palm Beach, CA) LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer operated in anionic mode. The source temperature was kept at 200�C and the tuning parameters were adjusted by minimizing the incidence of ammonium adducts. All nucleic acid constructs were obtained from commercial sources and utilized upon buffer exchange against 150 mM ammonium acetate (pH adjusted to 7.0). Typical sample concentrations were in the 0.5 - 2.0 uM range. </p>
